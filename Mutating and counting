#Use mutate() to calculate and add a column called population_walk, containing the total number of people who walk to work in a county
#Use a (weighted and sorted) count() to find the total number of people who walk to work in each state.



counties_selected %>%
  # Add population_walk containing the total number of people who walk to work 
  mutate(population_walk = population * walk / 100) %>%
  # Count weighted by the new column, sort in descending order
